How to play
=======
Make a portal out of logs and light it with glow powder.
Glow powder can be made by using 4 glowstone and 5 redstone. The redstone should be in an X pattern while crafting.
I suggest exploring the water first and getting some bone materials from the baracudas before trying to take on the trees,
The plants underwater can be right-clicked to refill your air bar.

Compiling
=======
Take the source and place it into the src folder in a working mcp directory.
Compile and reobfuscate.
Pack a .jar file manually with the assets folder.
